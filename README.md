# quivia

This game was originally going to be called "Quivia," but that name was already taken, so the final production version has been renamed to:

# Brainium

Brainium uses the Open Triva DB (https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) to provide the questions, the correct answer, and three wrong answers.

Users get to answer questions until the get three wrong answers. At that point the game is over and they can save their score to the leader board.

There's a skip button that can be used three times for hard questions. After three uses, the skip button disappears.

Questions range in difficulty from easy to medium to hard.  Here's the scoring:

Easy: +5pts
Medium: +10pts
Hard: +20pts

Wrong Answer: -5pts

Good luck!
